                            <li>Hosts requiring a guest to leave a positive review or rating, or to revise a review in exchange for a partial or full refund, or reciprocal review. Hosts also can’t offer a free or discounted stay in exchange for a guest revising an existing review.</li>
                            <li>Hosts asking a guest to take specific actions related to a review in exchange for a resolution to a dispute between the parties.</li>

                        <p>Last Updated: December 12, 2018</p>
                        <p>By making a booking and choosing to pay less upfront (“Pay Less Upfront Feature” or “Feature”), you agree to these Pay Less Upfront Terms of Service (“Pay Less Upfront Terms”), which amend Airbnb’s Terms of Service (“Airbnb Terms”) and Payments Terms of Service (“Payments Terms”) and are effective as of the date when you first book and use the Pay Less Upfront Feature.</p>
                        <p>All capitalized terms not defined have the meaning given to them in the Airbnb Terms and Payments Terms. If there is a conflict between the Airbnb Terms or Payments Terms and the Pay Less Upfront Terms, the Pay Less Upfront Terms control.</p>
                        <p>The Pay Less Upfront Feature allows Guests to pay a portion of a booking’s Total Fees at the time of booking and pay the remainder of the Total Fees at a later time prior to check-in. The Pay Less Upfront Feature is available to Guests for eligible bookings when they pay with certain Payment Methods. If your booking is eligible for the Pay Less Upfront Feature, the Airbnb Site, Application or Services (collectively, the “Airbnb Platform”) will notify you during checkout.</p>
                        <p>If you choose to book with the Pay Less Upfront Feature, the Airbnb Platform will notify you of the amount and schedule of each payment due. On the second payment due date, Airbnb Payments will automatically charge the original Payment Method you used to make the booking. Gift Cards and credits cannot be used for the second payment. Therefore, to the extent a gift card or credit is used for the initial booking using Pay Less Upfront, Airbnb will only charge the gift card or credit up to the first scheduled amount due.</p>
                        <p>If you make a modification to a booking made with the Feature, you will be notified of the revised payment schedule, as applicable, via the Airbnb Platform. If the modification increases your Total Fees, you may be required to make an additional partial payment of the new Total Fees at the time of the modification.</p>

                                            The host service fee for homes is generally 3%, but may be higher for hosts in Italy or hosts who have a Super Strict cancellation policy. This fee is calculated from the booking subtotal (the nightly rate plus cleaning fee and additional guest fee, if applicable, but excluding Airbnb fees and taxes) and is automatically deducted from the payout to the host.
                                            <br /><br>To review the service fee charged for a particular booking: <br><br>

                                            <h2>Guest service fees</h2>
                                            The guest service fee for homes ranges between 0% and 20% of the booking subtotal (the nightly rate plus cleaning fee and additional guest fee, if applicable, but excluding Airbnb fees and taxes) and is calculated using a variety of factors—these include the reservation subtotal, the length of the stay, and characteristics of the listing. In general, the service fee gets lower as the reservation cost gets higher. Guests see this fee on the checkout page before they book a reservation.
                                            <br /><br>
                                            If Airbnb is required to collect VAT, the service fee and VAT amounts will be combined on the checkout page, which could make the service fee appear to be higher than 20%.

                                                We charge hosts who offer experiences a 20% service fee. This is calculated based on the price of the experience and is automatically deducted from the host’s payout. Hosts who participate in nonprofit partnerships for experiences have this fee waived.

                                                We currently do not charge a guest service fee for experiences.

                                                <h2>VAT charges on service fees</h2>
                                                Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction involved, VAT may be charged on top of the host and guest service fee. The service fee will include these VAT charges when applicable.

                                                    Paying and communicating through Airbnb helps ensure that you're protected under our Terms of Service, Payments Terms of Service, cancellation and refund policies, Host Guarantee, Host Protection Insurance program and other safeguards. It also makes it easy to find and reference important reservation details like a listing's address, your itinerary, check-in details, and other useful information. We can’t provide these benefits if your reservation isn’t booked and paid for directly through Airbnb.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                    Paying or communicating outside of Airbnb also makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues, such as phishing.
                                            </p>

                                                    Never pay for your reservation outside of Airbnb.

                                        When deciding whether to become an Airbnb host, it's important for you to understand how the laws work in your city.
                                        <br>
                                        Some cities have laws that restrict your ability to host paying guests for short periods. These laws are often part of a city's zoning or administrative codes. In many cities, you must register, get a permit, or obtain a license before you list your property or accept guests. Certain types of short-term bookings may be prohibited altogether. Local governments vary greatly in how they enforce these laws. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement.
                                        <br>
                                        These rules can be confusing. We're working with governments around the world to clarify these rules so that everyone has a clear understanding of what the laws are. 
                                        <br>
                                        In some tax jurisdictions, Airbnb will take care of calculating, collecting, and remitting local occupancy tax on your behalf. Occupancy tax is calculated differently in every jurisdiction, and we’re moving as quickly as possible to extend this benefit to more hosts around the globe.
                                        <br>
                                        In the meantime, please review your local laws before listing your space on Airbnb. More information about your city's laws and regulations may be available on our Responsible Hosting page in the Your City's Regulations section.
                                        <br>
                                        By accepting our Terms of Service and activating a listing, you certify that you will follow your local laws and regulations.

                                                When deciding whether to become an Airbnb host, it’s important for you to understand the laws in your city. As a platform and marketplace, we don’t provide legal advice, but we do want to give you some useful links that may help you better understand laws and regulations in your town, city, county, or state. This list is not exhaustive, but it should give you a good start in understanding the kinds of laws that may apply to you. If you have questions, contact your local government, or consult a local lawyer or tax professional.

                                                    <li><b>Business Licenses: </b>Many cities and counties require owners or operators of certain businesses to apply for and obtain a license before the business can be operated. Many local governments have sections of their websites explaining the business licensing process, and providing you with relevant forms and information. Contact your city or county for more information.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Building and Housing Standards: </b>Most local governments and many states have rules and regulations specifying minimum construction, design, and maintenance standards for buildings, including regulations on habitability, health, and safety. Certain rules applicable to residential and non-residential uses may be relevant to your listing. Some cities or counties may also require an inspection of your property to make sure it meets minimum habitability standards. Contact your local government to find out what standards apply to your listing.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Zoning Rules: </b>Most cities and counties have laws that set out the way you can use your home. These rules are often found in a zoning code, planning code, or city ordinances. You should consult these rules or regulations to see if your listing is consistent with current zoning requirements or use definitions, or contact your local government directly.</li>
